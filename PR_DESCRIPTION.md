## Commits

### 1. fix(features): handle high alpha in Lasso when n_features_to_select specified
**Problem**: Lasso with default alpha=1.0 would select zero features when L1 regularization zeroed all coefficients, breaking stability selection and workflows.

**Solution**: Modified `_select_features()` to always select top-k features by magnitude when `n_features_to_select` is specified, even if coefficients are near-zero.

### 2. feat(features): implement Stability Selection framework
**Implementation**: Complete bootstrap-based stability selection wrapper for any BaseFeatureSelector.

**Key Features**:
- Bootstrap resampling (configurable n_bootstraps, sample_fraction)
- Stability scoring (selection frequency across bootstraps)
- Threshold-based filtering (default 0.6 = selected in 60%+ of bootstraps)
- Works with ANY base selector (Lasso, RF, mRMR, etc.)
- sklearn's `clone()` for reliable estimator copying

**Based on**:
- Meinshausen & Bühlmann (2010) "Stability selection"
- Pusa & Rousu (2024) "Stable biomarker discovery in multi-omics data"

**Example**:
```python
from omicselector2.features.stability import StabilitySelector
from omicselector2.features.classical.lasso import LassoSelector

base = LassoSelector(n_features_to_select=50)
selector = StabilitySelector(
    base_selector=base,
    n_bootstraps=100,
    threshold=0.7
)
selector.fit(X, y)

# Get stability scores
for feature, score in selector.stability_scores_.items():
    if score > 0.8:
        print(f"{feature}: {score:.2f}")
```

### 3. feat(features): implement Ensemble Methods framework
**Implementation**: Complete ensemble framework with 5 aggregation strategies.

**Strategies**:
1. **Majority voting**: Select features voted by ≥ threshold% of selectors (default 50%)
2. **Soft voting**: Weighted average of normalized feature scores
3. **Consensus ranking**: Borda count rank aggregation
4. **Intersection**: Features selected by ALL selectors (most conservative)
5. **Union**: Features selected by ANY selector (most inclusive)

**Based on**:
- OmicSelector 1.0 automated benchmarking philosophy
- Saeys et al. (2008) ensemble feature selection

**Example**:
```python
from omicselector2.features.ensemble import EnsembleSelector
from omicselector2.features.classical.lasso import LassoSelector
from omicselector2.features.classical.random_forest import RandomForestSelector

selectors = [
    LassoSelector(n_features_to_select=20),
    RandomForestSelector(n_features_to_select=20),
    mRMRSelector(n_features_to_select=20),
]

# Majority voting (at least 2/3 must agree)
ensemble = EnsembleSelector(
    selectors=selectors,
    strategy="majority",
    threshold=0.67
)
ensemble.fit(X, y)

# Check vote counts
for feature in ensemble.selected_features_[:10]:
    votes = ensemble.vote_counts_[feature]
    print(f"{feature}: {votes}/3 votes")
```

### 4. feat(features): implement HDG selector for single-cell RNA-seq
**Implementation**: High-Deviation Genes selector for identifying highly variable genes in scRNA-seq.

**Dispersion Metrics**:
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: std/mean (default, robust to scale)
- **Variance**: std² (sensitive to highly expressed genes)
- **Standard Deviation**: middle ground

**Key Features**:
- Unsupervised (doesn't require cell labels)
- Optional `min_mean` filter for low-expression genes
- Sample standard deviation (ddof=1) for statistical correctness
- Deterministic, fast computation

**Based on**:
- Brennecke et al. (2013) "Accounting for technical noise in single-cell RNA-seq"
- Scanpy/Seurat HVG detection

**Example**:
```python
from omicselector2.features.single_cell.hdg import HDGSelector

# Select top 2000 HVGs by coefficient of variation
selector = HDGSelector(n_features_to_select=2000, metric="cv")
selector.fit(adata.to_df(), cell_types)

# Filter low-expression genes
selector = HDGSelector(
    n_features_to_select=2000,
    metric="cv",
    min_mean=0.01  # Exclude genes with mean < 0.01
)
hvg_matrix = selector.fit_transform(expression_matrix, y)
```

### 5. feat(features): implement HEG selector for single-cell RNA-seq
**Implementation**: High-Expression Genes selector for identifying highly expressed genes in scRNA-seq.

**Aggregation Metrics**:
- **Mean**: Average expression across cells (default)
- **Median**: Robust to outlier cells
- **Sum**: Total expression (sensitive to highly expressed genes)

**Key Features**:
- Unsupervised (doesn't require cell labels)
- Percentile-based selection (e.g., top 10% by expression)
- Absolute number selection (e.g., top 500 genes)
- Deterministic, fast computation
- Complements HDG (variability-based selection)

**Use Cases**:
- Identify highly expressed marker genes
- Filter lowly expressed genes in preprocessing
- QC check for expected cell type markers
- Combine with HDG for comprehensive gene selection

**Example**:
```python
from omicselector2.features.single_cell.heg import HEGSelector

# Select top 500 genes by mean expression
selector = HEGSelector(n_features_to_select=500, metric="mean")
selector.fit(adata.to_df(), cell_types)

# Or select by percentile (top 10%)
selector = HEGSelector(percentile=90, metric="mean")
top_genes = selector.fit_transform(expression_matrix, y)
```
