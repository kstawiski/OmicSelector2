"""Single-cell RNA-seq specific feature selection methods.

Methods optimized for scRNA-seq data characteristics:
- HDG (High-Deviation Genes): Captures cell-to-cell variability
- HEG (High-Expression Genes): Mean expression filtering
- FEAST (Fast Entropy-based Active Set Testing)
- DUBStepR (Determining Useful Biomarker Suites via Step-wise Regression)
- Highly Variable Genes (HVG) detection
- Marker gene identification per cluster
